# Vuetify Blog Challenge

A blog application built with Vue and Vuetify as part of the Vuetify Developer Code Challenge. This application provides a complete CRUD system for managing blog posts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a local-only design that uses IndexedDB (via IDB) for data persistence, eliminating the need for a backend server while still maintaining state through page refreshes.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the dialog logic is inspired by my previous work here: [github.com/nuxt/ui/pull/3279](https://github.com/nuxt/ui/pull/3279)
